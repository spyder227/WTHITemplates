    <header-large>what we could have been</header-large>
    <header-xsmall>he/him. 40+. open powers, open face.</header-xsmall>
    Meet <b>MITCH EVANS</b>, Emily's former partner (and situationship) from her time in the CIA. He's at least a few years older than her and was already an experienced agent by the time she joined the agency in 2012. They saw each other around a few times during her internship, then when she was promoted to a proper field agent position in 2013 they became partners... and also began sleeping together, because <i>that</i> was never going to get messy at all.<br><br>
    See, Mitch developed feelings for Emily very early on, and while she never felt the same way that he did, the sex was good and she thought it was easier than trying to date outside of work. She and Mitch were never officially a couple, but their relationship wasn't exactly <i>subtle</i> to the others they worked with, so it was kind of a well-known secret that she spent more time in his bed than her own.<br><br>
    Things came to a messy end in 2019 when, during an operation, Mitch was shot and in her panic, Emily's powers finally came to light. She dragged him from the building, but not after setting fire to it with her abilities, which he hadn't known about before then. After that, she basically ghosted him, quitting the CIA and moving on to the first police department that would hire her, which is how she ended up in Limbo just a few years ago.<br><br>
    Now, this doesn't mean Mitch's feelings for Emily have disappeared. In fact, I would love for him to have not given up on trying to reach out to her, especially if it leads to him finally tracking her down in Limbo. She's not bound to answer her phone if he calls... but there's not much she can do if he just shows up at her door one day, is there?<br><br>
    Please note that this is <i>not</i> a romance wanted ad. Depending on where she is in her own romance, they might hook up again, but they also might not- and she certainly isn't going to develop feelings for Mitch beyond platonically caring about him, the way she does already. She's terrified of how he might think of her after learning about her powers, but I'd love to see her have to face that fear at last, and maybe even finally confront his unrequited feelings for her.<br><br>
    I am flexible on things like <b>name</b>, <b>face claim</b>, and <b>powers</b>, but he must be at least 40 years old and preferably hadn't told Emily about his own powers (if he has any) at any point.

    <header-large>it was us against the world</header-large>
    <header-xsmall>he/him. 34yo. open powers, open face.</header-xsmall>
    <b>JOHN COOLRIDGE</b> was Emily's first "love", the boyfriend she had as a teenager in Italy that got her pregnant and then backed out of the relationship when he learned about it. This is what put her onto the path she travels today: gave her trust issues, yes, but also prompted her to get her life together and go to Yale.<br><br>
    But not before having an abortion. And never, ever speaking about it to anybody except their mutual friend Matthew, who has since passed away.<br><br>
    It's largely flexible what John's been up to in the years since his and Emily's break-up, but I think it could be really interesting to have him end up in Limbo, either because he tracked her down (through Matthew, through her mother, through somebody else entirely?) or completely by accident. Many details about him are open, including his <b>name, face claim,</b> and <b>powers</b> (if he has any), but he must be roughly the same age as Emily and have lived in Rome, Italy when he was about 15-16 years old!<br><br>
    If you think you might be interested in picking him up, feel free to hit me up on Discord!

    <header-large>in the mind of a criminal</header-large>
    <header-xsmall>guns & gangs unit of the lcpd.</header-xsmall>
    You read that right, this is the <b>Criminal Minds</b>-inspired Guns & Gangs force of the Limbo City Police Department! I'm not necessarily going to enforce reserves/matching characters one-for-one, but I <i>will</i> name some of the archetypes I'd love to see join us on site!<br><br>
    Please note: We've already got both the <b>PRENTISS</b> and the <b>JJ</b> in the form of Emily Lawry and Aiden Mitchell, played by me and Lux respectively - so don't hesitate to reach out for some existing connections there!<br><br>
    <inlineheader-small>THE "GARCIA"</inlineheader-small> The force's resident tech genius. Probably greatly experienced in <i>illegal</i> hacking as well as the more legal side that the job requires. This person would also ideally be eccentric, flamboyant, and unapologetic about who they are - and would complete the triad with Em and Aiden of the LCPD's "dynamic trio".<br><br>
    <inlineheader-small>THE "REID"</inlineheader-small> The resident genius, probably a little socially awkward as well but the rest of the team loves them anyways. This person has never really fit in anywhere before, but the team accepts them just as they are, and even treats them like a beloved little sibling (because this person <i>is</i> probably younger than most of them!).<br><br>
    <inlineheader-small>THE "MORGAN"</inlineheader-small> The badass with a heart of gold. Probably has a bit of a temper, but would never hurt anybody that hadn't more than earned it. I'd love for this person to have a close partnership with Emily as well... even if they're not bound to be invited to "girls' night" quite as often as Aiden and "the Garcia".<br><br>
    <inlineheader-small>THE "HOTCH"</inlineheader-small> The leader of the team. No-nonsense, a dry sense of humor, resting bitch face but would die for any one of their officers if they had to. I'd also love for this person to have a mentor kind of relationship with Emily if possible; maybe they even did some work for her mother when she was younger!<br><br>
    One last note: <b>names, ages, genders, powers,</b> and <b>face claims</b> are all incredibly flexible! In fact, diversity and branching out is encouraged!

    <header-large>the blood runs thicker</header-large>
    <header-xsmall>1 younger sister & 1 older sister.</header-xsmall>
    The Dresden siblings grew up wealthy in Seattle, primarily raised by nannies and other caretakers while their father was away on "business". They eventually learned that "business" really meant a gigantic drug-and-arms-dealing ring, which Callum Dresden was finally criminally charged for in 2013. After nearly ten years of court battles, he was convicted and imprisoned, and Auggie and his two sisters were relocated to Limbo where they were instructed to "lay low" and avoid getting caught up in any more trouble.<br><br>
    <inlineheader-small>VANESSA DRESDEN</inlineheader-small> She's the older sister and the "hardworking" one- she always felt responsible for her younger siblings, even while they were in the care of nannies, and she might lowkey resent them for not showing her the same care back. She has major "eldest daughter" syndrome and probably not a lot of patience for Auggie and "Bianca"'s antics these days, but she really does care about them still and want them both to make something of themselves.<br><br>
    <inlineheader-small>BIANCA DRESDEN</inlineheader-small> She's the younger sister and the "princess" of the family, with an unhealthy dependency on Auggie who she's always looked up to. She's spoiled and likes being pampered, but resents the idea that she can't take care of herself and tends to get petulant when she's called out on it. She might also feel blamed (whether that's true or not) by the other siblings for the death of their mother, who passed away shortly after she was born.<br><br>
    Some details are flexible, such as <b>exact ages</b> and <b>powers</b> (if any), but each sister should fit the general vibe I've outlined above! Also, either sister can absolutely be trans/GNC if that's an angle you were hoping to play - honestly, I'm super open here!

    <header-large>my brother under the sun</header-large>
    <header-xsmall>he/him. 37yo. open powers, open face.</header-xsmall>
    Meet <b>ALBERTO "AJ" MENDOZA JR</b>, Isaac's little brother and the reason he has a major inferiority complex to this day. AJ was a child prodigy and an expert at everything he set his mind to, whether music or art or even mathematics, which left Isaac feeling like a disappointment for most of his childhood even though their mother never consciously tried to impress that feeling upon him.<br><br>
    They were raised by a single mother after the death of their father when Isaac was six and AJ was one. They were never rich, but mom worked hard to provide for the boys and I'd like to imagine AJ became relatively successful for it. Isaac did, too, in a way - he's written music for some high-profile bands - but he feels washed-up and inferior compared to his brother, and for this reason kind of resents him to this day.<br><br>
    Which, of course, means I'd <i>love</i> to have AJ on-site!<br><br>
    Ethnicity, of course, should be Chilean/Latin American, and he should be roughly five years younger than Isaac (making him 37 years old at present), but I'm flexible on things like his actual personality and his powers if he has any! Feel free to reach out to me if you might be interested in taking him on!
